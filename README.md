# FootballWorldCup

Setting up the Project:

Commit 50ac44d3: A Readme.md file has been created. This is the most straightforward way to describe the project on GitHub.
Commit e299577f: In the FootballWorldCup solution, I will add two projects. The first one will be a simple console application, and the second is an xUnit Test project.


Development:
Commit 74550fc4: At the beginning of my task, I will write a test, StartGame_ShouldAddNewMatch(). This test verifies whether starting a game adds a new match to the scoreboard and sets the initial scores correctly. Subsequently, we create the FootballWorldCupScoreBoard class, which currently includes two methods: StartGame and GetSummaryByTotalScore.

Commit e1508b1b:
The focus for this task is not to create a REST API, a Web Service, or a Microservice. For communication with the methods, we will use the Console. This is the step where we are going to implement a simple console menu.

Step3:
Next step is the implementation of UpdateScore_ShouldUpdateMatchScore() test and UpdateScore method. Also console menu is updated with the new feature
