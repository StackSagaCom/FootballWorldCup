# FootballWorldCup

At the beginning of my task, I will write a test StartGame_ShouldAddNewMatch(). This test verifies whether starting a game adds a new match to the scoreboard and sets the initial scores correctly. Subsequently, we create the FootballWorldCupScoreBoard class, which currently includes two methods, StartGame and GetSummaryByTotalScore.
